# Understanding Front Matter in Hugo

Front matter is a key feature in Hugo that allows you to define metadata for your pages and posts.

## What is Front Matter?

Front matter is a block of metadata placed at the beginning of a content file (like `markdown.md`). It’s enclosed in delimiters (`---` for YAML, `+++` for TOML, and `{}` for JSON) and allows you to define properties for the content.

For example, the following front matter sets the title, date, and draft status:

draft: false

Writing Front Matter in Different Formats
Hugo supports three formats for front matter:

YAML: Uses --- delimiters. Most readable and commonly used.
TOML: Uses +++ delimiters. Ideal for configurations.
JSON: Uses {}. Less common due to verbose syntax.
Best Practices for Front Matter
Keep it clean: Only include fields supported by your theme or required for functionality.
Use meaningful descriptions: Improve SEO by writing engaging descriptions.
Leverage automation: Use Hugo archetypes to predefine default front matter for new posts.
