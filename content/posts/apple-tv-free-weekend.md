### Streaming Details
While Apple hasn't specified whether the free access includes the entire Apple TV Plus library or only Apple Originals content, this promotion follows similar strategies used by other streaming platforms like HBO and Netflix. The company teased this offering last week through their social media channels, promoting it with a trailer showcasing their top shows under the tagline "see for yourself."

### How to Watch
The free streaming weekend starts January 4th and runs through January 5th, 2024. This provides enough time for viewers to sample several episodes of Apple's acclaimed series or potentially binge-watch shorter shows.
