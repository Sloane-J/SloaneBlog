A deeply troubling incident in South Carolina has drawn attention to the devastating effects of bullying. A 12-year-old girl, driven to attempt suicide after enduring relentless harassment at her middle school, was mocked in a horrifying way even after her tragic act. According to a new lawsuit, the bullies snuck into the hospitalâ€™s intensive care unit where the victim was being treated, took photos of her, and shared them on social media to ridicule her.

The victim, Kelaia Turner, now 14, suffered over a year of physical and verbal abuse by five classmates at Dr. Phinnize J. Fisher Middle School in Greenville, her family claims. The lawsuit accuses the school district and nine staff members of negligence, alleging their failure to intervene allowed the bullying to escalate.

In 2023, feeling hopeless and without escape, Kelaia hanged herself. Paramedics managed to revive her after she was clinically dead for eight minutes, but she sustained severe brain damage and remained in a coma for weeks. Her family's ongoing battle for justice highlights the urgent need for stronger anti-bullying measures and accountability in schools.
